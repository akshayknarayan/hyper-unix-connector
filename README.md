# hyper-unix-connector

Connect hyper servers and clients to Unix-domain sockets.

Most of this crate's functionality is borrowed from [hyperlocal](https://github.com/softprops/hyperlocal).
This was originally written to provide an async/await-compatible version of hyperlocal, but hyperlocal has since been updated with this feature. 
Therefore, *you probably want to use hyperlocal instead*. 

See [`UnixClient`] and [`UnixConnector`] for examples.
